- Create, delete, and manage users on the platform.
- Add, remove, and list friends for each user.
- Follow and unfollow brands, with a recommendation system for suggesting new friends and brands.
- Calculate degrees of connection between users in the social network.
- Suggest mutual friends and brands based on shared interests.

Language: C
Data Structures: Linked Lists, Graphs (Adjacency Matrix)
Algorithms: BFS (Breadth-First Search), Sorting (for linked lists)
Tools: Standard C libraries (e.g., stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h)
